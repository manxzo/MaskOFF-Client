### Components & Architecture

- **Pages & Components:**  
  - **Authentication:** Login and Create User pages.
  - **Dashboard:** Navigation to friend management, messaging, and finding users.
  - **Messaging:** A dedicated messages page that lists chats and provides real-time chat functionality.
  - **Feed Tabs (Planned):**  
    - **Tab 1:** Anonymous Introductions feed.
    - **Tab 2:** Posts feed for both regular posts and job posts (job posts marked with a `#Job` tag).  
      Both tabs will feature a reusable post input field at the top (similar to the input on Twitter/X) followed by a list of posts sorted by most recent. Tab 2 will include a filter button to view only regular posts or only `#Jobs`.

### Feed Tabs UI

The application will feature **two distinct feed tabs** on the Posts page:

1. **Tab 1: Anonymous/Introductions**
   - This tab will display anonymous posts (introductions).
   - At the top of the tab, a **reusable post input component** will allow users to submit new anonymous posts.
   - Posts will be displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

2. **Tab 2: Posts (Regular & Job Posts)**
   - This tab will show both regular community posts and job posts.
   - **Job posts** will have a simple `#Job` tag appended to them.
   - A **filter button** will allow users to toggle between viewing only regular posts or only job posts.
   - Like Tab 1, Tab 2 will begin with the same **reusable post input component** to create a new post, followed by the list of posts ordered from most recent to oldest.
